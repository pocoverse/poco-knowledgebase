## ERP Notes: 

- In case any data is missing, update the user to provide us data by mentioning a legend on the slide. 
- For gender, incase user has given contradictory information, use the relation data to confirm the gender.
- Emergency contacts to be mentioned in order of Primary, Secondary and Tertiary
- For the active medication case, if the user has provided us information for what they are taking medication, mention that in the Chronic Conditions. 
- Slides 5 & 6 are going to be constant across all the ERPs. 
- In case any detail is missing, mention “To be Updated” as a legend on a particular slide. 
- Process for identifying the hospitals: 
    - Identify all the hospitals in the area near to the beneficiary’s address. 
    - Check if the hospital is operational or not. This can be checked on google business/Google map/Google review/Hospital website/Call the hospital. 
    - If the hospital is operational, we will move ahead with it, in case it is not operational, remove it from the list. 
    - For an operational hospital, check the distance from the beneficiary’s address/location. First attempt is to get hospitals within 5Km radius, in case it is not available, start checking within 10Km, then keep on moving in the same way. 
    - Post identification of the hospital within the recommended distance, identify the speciality offering (Cardiology, Neurology, Orthopaedica, ENT, Emergency,  Pulmonologist, oncology, gastroenterologist, ophthalmologist, general physician, surgery, casualty or Emergency department or trauma center For all the offerings, just tick the checkbox. 
    - *Know if the hospital is accepting insurance, whether the insurance is Cashless or Reimbursement based*. 
    - For hospital list, update with a disclaimer: Lists are created on the basis of secondary research from Google and Internet. 
    :::danger Disclaimer: 
        About all the details like name, age, medicine details- we should mention that its a collective information which has been shared with us during the registration.
    :::

* Insurance data can only be provided once the user has shared their health policy details.
