# Test Suite | Freshdesk Integration

- Every new beneficiary that is created in the Pococare system creates a new FD ticket.

- On emergency QR scan a ticket is created in FD with the Beneficiary Details
    - In case if the first responder enters his mobile, his data must be captured in the ticket
    - In case if there is no first responder or if the first responder did not put his mobile, the calls and communication must go to the beneficiary.
