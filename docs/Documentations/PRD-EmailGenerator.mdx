Subject: Welcome to Pococare

Body:

** Dear Name of Subscriber, **
I want to take a second and not only thank you, but also congratulate you on making a GREAT decision towards taking care of your elderly dependents. 
There are many areas where the elderly need assistance. Housekeeping, food, logistics, security, regular health monitoring, lab tests, medicine ordering, prescription compliance are top of the mind needs but the biggest concern is emergency management. Our experience has shown how inadequately prepared most of us are. In many cases, the typical response to an emergency is to call a friend, a neighbor or a relative. What follows is frantic running around and, in many cases, it is not money that is the issue but lack of preparedness. Ambulances may reach on time only to find that the elderly person is in a house on a higher floor without a lift. Medical records are not readily available and health insurance eligibility is not clearly available or understood. These are partial glimpses from actual incidents and not a figment of imagination. 
When I founded Pococare the mission was to make the elderly population emergency ready. In addition to our emergency care services we are also happy to announce that we are adding services like groceries, laboratory tests, medicines, and legal assistance shortly. More to follow on this. 
The Pococare heartbeat team will be reaching out to you shortly to confirm the registration details and answer any questions that you may have. In the interim, you may read the FAQ [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zWXg0N-vxZTrggKzHtW7N7cFPX90syt-/view?usp=sharing). 
Again, welcome to the Pococare family. We are excited to be of help to you!
